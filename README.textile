h1. Project Lincoln

You can't beat a good beard.

h2. Folder system

* demo - all our little projects can go into here
* server - The server source code.
* client - The client rails project will go here

h2. Git info

Git doesn't like empty folders, so for now, I've added a .gitignore file to all these folders. Shouldn't be an issue, just fyi.
